## Inspiration

> We got inspired by earth Day and dicided to create something green. So we created *otter be active* an app that is helpful for the users and the environment.  

## What it does

**Otter be Active** is a web and mobile application that encourages users to get out more. Once installed, the app runs in the background, occassionally notifying the user with nearby opportunities to explore the area around them. We recommmend parks, hiking trails, and otter interesting places within reasonable walking distance, and if the user chooses to act on it, reward them with prestiege.

## How we built it

We used Node.JS and Apache Cordova to implment a cross platform mobile and web application. Our frontend incorporates the Material Design language and the Bootstrap framework to provide a reactive experience natively on iOS, Android, Windows, and all otter internet connected devices. The actual application uses the Cordova geolocation extension to access the device GPS location, and then processes the output of a Google Maps API call to determine the best recommendations.

## Challenges we ran into

> some of our peers were new with codeing and progams. which caused a delay and was slow procces to complate parts of the app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

> we are pround to create this app that will bring people together and will take them on adventures to our well presurved parks and inlighten them about the parks.

## What we learned

- How to use Apache Cordova

## What's next for Otter be Active
